## `name_cleanup.csv`
This CSV file contains cleaned-up data from the Villo! API data.

The "name" column is almost as reported by the API: I removed the number prefix according to the regex `'^\d+ *- *'`, and parentheses according to the regex `' *\([^)]*) *'`.

The `fr_norm` and `nl_norm` column are a first clean-up of the `name` column.
It simply consists of properly capitalized names with accents.
When only a single name exists, it is put in the `fr_norm` column and the `nl_norm` column is empty.

The `fr_shouldbe` and `nl_shouldbe` columns are what I think should be the names of the stations, whenever that differs from the cleaned up value.
In those columns, I fix misspellings and provide Dutch translations when there should be one.

The `fr_note` and `nl_note` specify why I provided values in `fr_shouldbe` or `nl_shouldbe`.

The `note` column contains some miscellaneous remarks.

## GeoJSON files
The three GeoJSON files show my proposal for corrected name tags in OpenStreetMap.
Each file shows the difference in one tag (`name`, `name:fr` or `name:nl`) from the old value (property `tag_from`) to the proposed new value (property `tag_to`), along with the OSM node identifier (property `_osm_id`), station number as reported by the Villo! API (property `_number`), and geographic position according to OSM.

To ease reviewing, the file for `name` tag changes omits corrections in formatting from `French / Dutch` to `French - Dutch`.
